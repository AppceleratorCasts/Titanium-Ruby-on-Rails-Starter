## Welcome to the **Web Ascender: Shuttle Pad** project

This is a project intended to give an example of how you can authenticate your Titanium Mobile
app with a Rails web app. Initally the mobile app will display a set of tabs for unauthenticated
users.  In the settings page there is a place for users to log in, which is set up to communicate with the
companion project **Web Ascender: Orbital Base**. (A Ruby on Rails web service that is configured to
authenticate the users on their mobile device.)
